Query Set used: Set 1
Search Engine: BING
-------------------------

Observation from Web Crawling:
Comparison of search engine results between GOOGLE and BING keeping GOOGLE as base gives us the following conclusions:

Average Percentage Overlap is 15.4%
This indicates that both search engines returns different sets of search results for the same set of queries. We can infer that each search engines prioritize different content
and index web differently. We can say that ~ 2 out of top 10 results match for the queries given.

Average Spearman Coefficient is -7.125
Spearman rank correlation coefficient measures the similarity between the rankings of two sets of data. We know that a perfect coefficient would be +1 which means both the search engines give identical results for the given set of queries.
But in our case, -7.125 signifies that not only google and bing return different search results, but for few results that overlap have different rankings and these ranks are often reversed i.e the result that is highly ranked by google might appear 
lower in bing and vice versa. This could also be one of the big reasons why certain search engines do not perform very well when we compare it with google.
